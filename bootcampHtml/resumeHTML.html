    <h3>Personal Projects</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Airplane Tracking Interface</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Utilizing the OpenSky Networkâ€™s API I constructed a program which finds the nearest airplane given a set of coordinates anywhere in the world.  The program will then return the planes coordinates, distance from the earth, callsign, and country of origin.</li>
        <li>Afterwards I constructed a graphical interface around the program using Tkinter, which includes error handling in the GUI</li>
        <li>I converted this program into an executable file which allows for easy distribution, and improves share-ability for programmers and non-programmers alike</li>
      </ul>

      <li><h5>LC4 Cipher Decryption</h5></li>
      <ul>
        <li>Decrypting the cipher starts with a 6x6 grid representing a specific alphabet.  Given an encrypted string the challenge is to find its decrypted partner</li>
        <li>The program places a marker in the top left corner of the grid.  Then it performs mathematical operations on the encrypted character to determine the vertical and horizontal movement from the marekr</li>
        <li>Using that movement we are able to find the decrypted character</li>
        <li>Afterwards we shift the column of the encrypted character and the row of the decrypted character</li>
        <li>Then we move the marker and repeat the process until the string is decrypted</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>UPMC</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Outreached to different organizations on a daily basis, including the IRS, The Federal Marketplace, and personal physicians</li>
        <li>Create 40+ documents to log each call with an inhouse system and database</li>
      </ul>

      <li>Southwestern Human Services</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Collected a sheet of data every 2-hour session while simultaneously performing behavioral interventions on the client (The client being a child of 5 or 6 years old with behavioral issues)</li>
        <li>Prepared each data sheet in an insurance friendly format, over 300 documents prepared in total</li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
